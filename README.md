# CodeKit Console

**CodeKit Console** is an interactive Java console application designed to execute a collection of commonly asked coding exercises. The tool allows users to test and run small programs, like Armstrong numbers, palindrome checks, array reversals, and recursion examples, using simple text commands. It eliminates the need to rewrite code each time, providing a reusable and efficient environment for learning and testing logic-based problems.

## Features

- Command-driven execution of 20+ coding exercises
- Built-in help system for user guidance
- Reusable methods for array manipulation, number operations, and recursion
- Clear console functionality for easier interaction
- Allows real-time testing and reusability of code

## Tools and Technologies

- **Java (JDK 17)**
- **Basic Console I/O**
- **Arrays and Recursion**
- **Optional: File Handling**

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the code.
2. Open the project in your Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse).
3. Run the main Java file to start the console application.
4. Use the command-driven interface to execute coding exercises.

## Examples

- **Armstrong Numbers**: Check if a number is an Armstrong number.
- **Palindrome Check**: Verify if a string or number is a palindrome.
- **Array Reversal**: Reverse an array.
- **Recursion Examples**: Run basic recursion exercises like factorial calculation.
